This project is a Django backend for PostgreSQL using psycopg > 2

The backend passes the entire Django test suite, but it needs a few
modifications of Django and the test suite. These changes will be proposed to
the Django project in a series of merge requests. The modifications are
available in the repository at https://github.com/dvarrazzo/django/, where the
backend has been developed (as the 'django.db.backends.postgresql_psycopg3'
module).
